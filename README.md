My solutions to Hacker Rank's challenges, written in node.js/ES6

## Why?
This repo was created to keep track of my solutions to Hacker Rank's challenges.

I chose to use node.js because it's fast and concise, and ES6 to improve my overall knowledge, and also because it makes no sense to start a new project writing ES5 in 2016.
